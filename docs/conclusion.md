## Future work

### Further testing

Although the projects used are a good sample of non trivial projects, as a dataset they do lack in variety, being mainly centered on scala language projects. Other projects could be added to the dataset to test for other languages and tech stacks.

### Install and uninstall models functionality

TODO implement this couse it kinda sucks it is not implemented.

Given that the main part of the project was centered on testing the capabilities of LLMs, the installing and uninstalling of models on the user system was not prioritized.

As of now the models are installed if they are requested to be used by the user.

To improve the usability of AutoDev an install and uninstall functionality might be implemented to enable the user to request the installation of a model esplicitly and to uninstall an installed model from their system.

As of now the only way to uninstall a model is.

### turn the project into a pip package
