 Here is the updated flake.nix file with the required modifications to resolve the syntax errors and make it compatible with Nix 2.x:

nix
{ nix, nix-gh }:

stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  name = "acceptance_testing";

  buildInputs = [ stdenv nix-gh ];

  src = ./.;

  phases = "build";

  environment.systemPackages = [
    python37
  ];
}
