 Here's the corrected version of your `flake.nix` file:

nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

# Here is the content for the flake.nix file:
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "my-flake";

  src = ./.;

  buildInputs = [ pkgs.cmake ];

  # This line should fix the syntax error you were experiencing
  buildCommands = []
    ''
      cmake -B build
      make -C build
    '';
}


This version removes the extra colon at the end of the line, fixing the syntax error.
