 Here is the corrected flake.nix file:

nix
nix = import <nixpkgs> {};
stdenv = builtins.fetchFromGitHub {
  owner = "scali-labs"
  repo = "space"
  rev = "main"
  sha256 = "0qw4hj3xz79p61fk8r80m2n8b2s7c86rk7s9i1j1";
}

{ stdenv, nix-build }:

stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  name = "space-scafi";
  src = ./.;
  buildInputs = [nix-build];
  buildPhase = () -> {
    cd $$src
    nix-build -A space
  };
}


Make sure to replace the `sha256` value with the correct hash of the latest commit in your local repository. You can find the SHA256 by running:

bash
git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 1
