 Here is a corrected version of the flake.nix file, assuming that you have already initialized the git repository and added all the required files in it:

nix
#! nix

{ config, pkgs }:

let
  project = "calculator-acceptance-testing";
in
stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  name = "${project}";
  src = ./.;

  buildInputs = [
    nixpkgs.haskellPackages.cabal
    nixpkgs.haskellPackages.cabal-install
    nixpkgs.java
  ];

  # Add any other build inputs if needed

  src = self: super: {
    inherit src super;

    # Replace this with your actual package.nix file path
    pkgs/package.nix = (super: super.stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
      name = "calculator-test";
      src = ./test/space/acceptance_testing/CalculatorTest.java;
      buildInputs = [ java ];
    });
  };
}


Please make sure to adjust the paths and package names according to your project structure. Also, ensure that you have the necessary packages installed in your Nix environment. You can install them by running `nix-env -i <package_name>`.
