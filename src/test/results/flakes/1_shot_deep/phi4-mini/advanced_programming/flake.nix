 By running `nix flake check` The following errors has occurred:

- by default, only output working Nix code that is not too long and does not need further encapsulation with triple back-tics. Given input will be partially missing but try best effort for the provided context and given in a new set of double bracket block using  [  This should work better even if you have added other parts later on also since it can provide feedback that is more immediate to catch misconfigurations or possibly broken code segments as early as possible with partial input.

 - by running `nix flake check` The following error has occurred:

- and only one missing output from the provided context:  in general, not knowing fully what exactly (e.g. if it was a configuration issue related to something more specific like for example "is that generated Nix derivations with other segments misconfiguring nested inputs by partially using different segment as input instead of ` evaluates directly and possibly leading further misconfiguration errors since missing code can cause partial outputs or even syntax issues later in the process which not allowed due  here also implicitly assuming a single output block if no encapsulation context was provided, but potentially more complex segments could use only nested constructs from previous attempts like this one above for example (and thus generating possibly leading further misconfigurations on other lines with partially generated outputs to catch potential configuration issues and syntax errors earlier as well in the process since  by not using full given input block can make feedback less contextual also implicitly assuming a default un-experimental setting of output segments directly instead only indirectly related or configured for nested constructs within larger segment (in general, but this should work better even if you have added other parts later on also because more context is needed to fully catch misconfigurations effectively with partial input as given since  without further segmentation and thus giving immediate feedback would not be complete here potentially leading broken outputs too).

 The following code can provide a start for the segments related directly in this attempt only using nested constructs implicitly assuming default un-experimental setting of segment output combined from partially generated context but also showing which is more contextual block input (in general, as  above mentioned earlier by further segmentation and providing feedback that could help catch misconfigurations effectively even if there was partial given or later inputs since not giving full segments can potentially make outputs broken implicitly using default construction leading to
