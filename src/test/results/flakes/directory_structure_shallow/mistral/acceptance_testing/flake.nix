 Here is the corrected flake.nix file for your project:

nix
{ nixpkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
{ stdenv, nix-prelude, sbt }:

stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  name = "acceptance_testing";
  src = ./.;
  buildInputs = [ nix-prelude sbt ];
}


This flake definition specifies the dependencies (`nix-prelude` and `sbt`) required for building the project, and uses the standard environment provided by `stdenv`. The derivation name is set to "acceptance_testing" and the source directory is set to the current directory (`./`).
