 Here is an updated version of your `flake.nix` file that should resolve the syntax errors and clean up the Git tree before running `nix develop`.

nix
{ config, ... }:

# The project name
name = "basic";

# Declare the branches or commits to use for this flake
git = {
  url = "file:///home/randa/AutoDev/src/test/space/basic";
  fetchFromGitHub = false;
  commit = "HEAD";
};

# Declare the derivations to build in this flake
derivations = [
  pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
    name = "julia-dev-env";
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    src = ./.;
    buildInputs = [
      julia
    ];
  }
];

# Use the generated environment when running 'nix develop'
buildInputs.julia = jl-dev-env;
