To resolve the error `undefined variable 'scala-3'` in your `flake.nix` file, you need to correct the package name for Scala 3.3.5. The correct package name in Nixpkgs is `scala-3.3.5`, not `scala-3`. Additionally, ensure the syntax is valid and that the structure of the `flake.nix` file is properly formatted.

### ‚úÖ **Corrected `flake.nix`**

nix
{
  description = "Scala 3.3.5 + SBT 1.10.7 development environment";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
    let
      pkgs = nixpkgs.pkgs;
      system = "x86_64-linux";
    in
    {
      devShells."${system}".default = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
        name = "scala-sbt-env";
        buildInputs = [
          # Scala 3.3.5
          pkgs.scala-3.3.5
          # SBT 1.10.7
          pkgs.sbt-1.10.7
        ];
        shellHook = ''
          export PATH=$HOME/.sbt/boot/:$PATH
          export PATH=$HOME/.ivy2/cache/:$PATH
        '';
      };
    };
}

### üîç **Explanation of Fixes**

1. **Correct Package Name**  
   - The error `undefined variable 'scala-3'` indicates that the package name was incorrect.
   - In Nixpkgs, the correct package name for Scala 3.3.5 is `scala-3.3.5`, not `scala-3` or `scala`.

2. **Ensure Proper Syntax**  
   - The original code likely had a typo or incorrect package name, which caused the error.
   - The corrected version uses `pkgs.scala-3.3.5` and `pkgs.sbt-1.10.7` to reference the correct packages.

3. **Use `stdenv.mkDerivation`**  
   - This ensures that the shell environment is properly set up for development, including path exports for SBT and Ivy.

### üìå **Optional: Ensure Correct Nixpkgs Version**

If you're using an older version of Nixpkgs (like `nixos-25.05`), make sure that `scala-3.3.5` is available in that version. If it's not, consider updating to a newer version of Nixpkgs that includes Scala 3.3.5.

You can test this by running:

bash
nix-shell -p scala-3.3.5


If that fails, update your Nixpkgs URL to a more recent version, such as `nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/master"`.

### ‚úÖ **Final Notes**

- Always double-check package names in Nixpkgs using the `nix search` or `nix-env` tools.
- Make sure your `flake.nix` is well-formatted and free of syntax errors (e.g., missing braces, commas, or semicolons).
- If you're using a newer version of Nixpkgs, ensure that the version you're using supports Scala 3.3.5 and SBT 1.10.7.
