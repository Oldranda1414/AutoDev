 Here is the updated `flake.nix` file that should resolve the syntax error and properly define the development environment for your Scala project:

nix
{ stdenv, sbt }:

derivation {
  name = "advanced_programming";

  src = ./.;

  buildInputs = [ sbt ];

  buildPhase = ''
    # Ensure the project is checked out
    git checkout

    # Run SBT to download dependencies and compile the project
    sbt update
  '';

  environment.systemPackages = [
    # Add any system packages that are required for your project here
  ];
}
